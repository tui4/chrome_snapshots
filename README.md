# Chrome Snapshots
The beginnings of a Python program to visualise chrome/chromium usage patterns.

Developed on a Debian system in January 2014.

Inspiration came from the Anki SRS flashcard statistics page.

Essentially the intention was to show things like:
- Which day/hour do you use the browser most
- The number of websites viewed per hour/day 
- The time spent on particular sites (e.g. Time spent on YouTube)
- Patterns in browsing behaviour (e.g. focusing one one subject vs. browsing arbitrarily)
